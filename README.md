# Good Morning Mirror
The Productive Morning Smart Mirror

The Good Morning Mirror is a smart mirror designed to help users get a head start on their morning routine. This device will provide useful information to the user such as the time, weather, commute time and traffic, a todo/event list, and be able to maintain the reflective property of a mirror. Most of us have used some type of application that has helped us organize our lives and made us more productive. The problem with these applications are that we start to ignore them over time. We thought we could use the concept of a smart mirror to display the information from these applications so you are able to see it every time you are looking at the mirror. Having the ability to put all this helpful information on your mirror could help you stay on track and help you finish all your daily goals. We believe that having a plan will help you be as productive as possible. Not having to look at your phone to see what you have to do for the day will help avoid distractions and keep your productivity going throughout the day.
